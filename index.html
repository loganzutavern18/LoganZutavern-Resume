        Hello, My name is Logan Zutavern. Welcome to my webpage! I don‚Äôt know how you made it to this website but I‚Äôm very that you did. Since you are here, might as well tell you a little bit about myself. I am currently a second year Pre-Business student at the University of California, Riverside. I‚Äôm planning on working in the marketing field, primarily for the entertainment industry. My biggest passion is the business side of music and my ultimate goal is to understand how it fully works. 
        Even though I may be young, I have a fairly extensive resume and have had some very rewarding experiences. The first job I ever had was working at Sports Plus Day Camp where I helped children play games, develop social skills and have all around a fun summer. That job definitely helped me understand that everyone works in their own way. I have also worked at a dog rescue foundation called Animal Hope and Wellness. I loved working there so much because it was such a kind environment and the work we were doing was so important. My job was to help rehabilitate and socialize dogs that had been saved from the Chinese meat trade. This job definitely taught me a lot of useful skills like extreme patience, organization and time management. Personally, I had never walked a dog before I worked there and now I can say that I‚Äôve walked roughly 100 dogs, at the very least. 
        My next job was working as a production assistant on the RuPaul talk show. It was such an amazing experience. There is not a single mean person on that set! Everyone is so incredibly kind and I hope I get to go back one day. I did so many different kinds of jobs when I was there. I got lunch for RuPaul themselves, I steamed the curtain, I swept the whole set, I was a stand-in in the audience and I was used as a placeholder for lighting and camera purposes. My most recent job was being a production assistant once more for the company Renegade83. They are in charge of the show Naked and Afraid and all of its off-shoots. My job was helping organize all of the cameras and equipment in the storage facility. I was able to use the organizational skills that I learned from the other jobs very well. I learned so much about the entertainment industry during this job, which made it very exciting and helpful if I want to achieve my goal of working in the entertainment industry. Other tasks I had to do at the storage facility included inventorying the products, cleaning materials, and setting up kits that going to other countries. I currently have an internship at an independent music venue in Los Angeles. It is for one of my favorite venues ever so this is definitely the most personally rewarding experiences I have ever been given. My internship includes doing advertising for the venue and its sister venue on social medias. I make advertisements like ‚ÄúThis artist is performing tomorrow night here! Make sure you get your tickets as fast as you can!‚Äù Thank you for taking the time to read this.<br><br>
